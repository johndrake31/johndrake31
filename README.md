- 👋 Hi, I’m @johndrake31
- 🧗🏻‍♂️ My current coding level is a junior front-end. I know my way around SCSS, HTML, JS, and Angular. It's not always pretty but it's getting better.
- 👀 I’m interested in Typescript, React, Angular11 and beyond, SCSS, and all cool things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular 11 and have a strong grasp of how it works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me (linked-in is for professionals and I enjoy the respectful enviroment): https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-turn-may/
